<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO LOYAL</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>DEADPOOL VS WOLVERINE</h3>
<p>
  One of a hell action-comedy made. Big fan of the collaboration of RR and JH.
</p>
<h3>MIRACLE IN CELL #7</h3>
<p>
  One of the best Korean movies for me. I've watched it several times and cried
  every time I watched it
</p>
<h3>3 IDIOTS</h3>
<p>
  I watched it since I was in grade school and still watching it today. One of
  the best movie created.
